This code suffers from a subtle bug related to how PHP handles type juggling and comparison in the context of arrays and the `empty()` function.  Consider the following:

```php
<?php
$myArray = array(0 => 'value');

if (empty($myArray)) {
  echo 'Array is empty';
} else {
  echo 'Array is not empty';
}
?>
```

While it might seem that the array is not empty, because it contains the key '0' and its value,  `empty($myArray)` will evaluate to true. This is because `empty()` checks if a variable is considered empty. An array with only a zero-valued element is considered empty in this context.
